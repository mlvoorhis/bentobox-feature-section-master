## Overview

This project provided valuable hands-on experience with CSS Grid, especially when working with nested grids and adjusting layouts based on different configurations like 75%/25% or 25%/75%. I initially struggled with layout techniques, but learned that Flexbox's flex-basis couldâ€™ve simplified things, sparing me the complexity of nested grids. I also discovered the power of using padding and gap for consistent spacing, avoiding margin issues like doubling up.

### What I learned
<b>Nested Grids</b>:
This project gave me a lot of hands-on experience with nested grids,  using <code>grid-template-areas</code>, <code>grid-column</code>, <code>grid-template-columns</code>, and <code>grid-template-rows</code>. I learned how tricky it can be to manage the layout, especially when flipping the order of box items. Managing these nested grids for different box configurations (like switching between 75%/25% and 25%/75% columns) added unnecessary complexity to the project, making it harder to maintain.

<b>Flexbox</b>:
While I initially tried using <code>display: flex</code> and <code>flex-direction: column-reverse | row-reverse</code>, I abandoned my efforts, because I thought I wouldn't be able to lay them out unevenly (e.g. 60/40). I was wrong! <code>flex-basis</code> would've given be the effect I wanted without the headache. At least I got some valuable experience with some tricky nested grids.

<b>Padding & Gap for Consistent Spacing</b>:
When I used <code>margin</code> for the individual box spacing, I was having issues with the margins doubling up. I realized a simpler approach was to add <code>padding</code> for the outside lines and <code>gap</code> for the inside lines.
